# Introduction to Make

This repository holds the code to follow along with a tutorial on using [GNU 
Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for a data analysis pipeline.

The tutorial has since been incorporated into [The Turing 
Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), a lightly 
opinionated guide to reproducible data science.

The original tutorial can be found 
[here](https://gertjanvandenburg.com/files/talk/make.html).
